OWLY (Smart File Renamer) is a tool that automatically renames images and screenshots based on what is actually inside them, using OCR and OpenAI models to read the content and generate meaningful file names. It ships as Python scripts, a desktop app, and a native macOS app. There are three renaming methods, from a free local option to cloud-backed analysis.

**Live demo:** [owly-seven.vercel.app](https://owly-seven.vercel.app)

## 🌟 Features

### 1. 🚀 Basic Method
- **Free and Generic Renaming**: This method provides basic renaming functionality without the need for any external APIs.
- **Ideal for**: Users who need simple file renaming based on content without any additional cost.

### 2. 🛠️ Advanced Method 1: Base64 Encoding with OpenAI API
- **Base64 Encoding**: This method encodes file content using Base64 and sends it to OpenAI's API for smart renaming.
- **Utilizes**: OpenAI API for intelligent and context-aware renaming.
- **Ideal for**: Users who require advanced renaming capabilities with an emphasis on privacy, using local encoding before processing.

### 3. ☁️ Advanced Method 2: Cloudinary Integration with OpenAI API
- **Cloudinary Integration**: This method uploads files to Cloudinary and then uses OpenAI’s API to analyze and rename files based on their content.
- **Utilizes**: Cloudinary for image management and OpenAI API for content analysis.
- **Ideal for**: Users who manage large media libraries and require cloud-based storage and processing.

## 🛤️ Roadmap

The Smart Screenshots project is continuously evolving. Here's what's in the pipeline:

- **📂 Other Format Support**: Expanding support to include additional file formats such as PDFs, videos, and more.
- **📏 Larger Image Size Support**: Improving the system to handle and process larger image files efficiently.
- **🖥️ Mac App (In Progress)**: Developing a native Mac application for a more seamless and integrated experience.
